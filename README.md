## Driveway Analemma

4th December 2024

### Explanation: 

Does the Sun return to the same spot on the sky every day?Â  No.Â  A more visual answer is an analemma, a composite of sky images taken at the same time and from the same place over a year.Â  At completion, you can see that the Sun makes a figure 8 on the sky.  The featured unusual analemma does not, however, picture the Sun directly: it was created by looking in the opposite direction. All that was required was noting where the shadow of an edge of a house was in the driveway every clear day at the same time.  Starting in March in Falcon, Colorado, USA, the photographer methodically marked the shadow's 1 pm location. In one frame you can even see the photographer himself.  Although this analemma will be completed in 2025, you can start drawing your own driveway analemma -- using no fancy equipment -- as soon as today.
