## The Magnificent Tail of Comet McNaught

6th October 2024

### Explanation: 

Comet McNaught, the Great Comet of 2007, grew a spectacularly long and filamentary tail.  The magnificent tail spread across the sky and was visible for several days to Southern Hemisphere observers just after sunset.  The amazing ion tail showed its greatest extent on long-duration, wide-angle camera exposures.  During some times, just the tail itself was visible just above the horizon for many northern observers as well. Comet C/2006 P1 (McNaught), estimated to have attained a peak brightness of  magnitude -5 (minus five), was caught by the comet's discoverer in the featured image just after sunset in January 2007 from Siding Spring Observatory in Australia. Comet McNaught, the brightest comet in decades, then  faded as it moved further into southern skies and away from the Sun and Earth. Over the next month, Comet Tsuchinshanâ€“ATLAS, a candidate for the Great Comet of 2024, should display its most spectacular tails  visible from the Earth.
