## Planet Lines Across Water

5th May 2025

### Explanation: 

Whatâ€™s causing those lines? Objects in the sky sometimes appear reflected as lines across water â€” but why? If the waterâ€™s surface is smooth, then reflected objects would appear similarly -- as spots. But if the water is choppy, then there are many places where light from the object can reflect off the water and still come to you -- and so together form, typically, a line. The same effect is frequently seen for the Sun just before sunset and just after sunrise. Pictured about 10 days ago in Ibiza, Spain, images of the setting Moon, Venus (top), and Saturn (right, faint) were captured both directly and in line-reflected forms from the Mediterranean Sea. The other bright object on the right with a water-reflected line is a beacon on a rock to warn passing boats.   Explore Your Universe: Random APOD Generator
