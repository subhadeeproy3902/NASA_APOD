## Planets of the Solar System: Tilts and Spins

14th September 2025

### Explanation: 

How does your favorite planet spin? Does it spin rapidly around a nearly vertical axis, or horizontally, or backwards?  The featured video animates NASA images of all eight planets in our Solar System to show them spinning side-by-side for an easy comparison. In the time-lapse video, a day on Earth -- one Earth rotation -- takes just a few seconds.  Jupiter rotates the fastest, while Venus spins not only the slowest (can you see it?), but backwards.  The inner rocky planets across the top underwent dramatic spin-altering collisions during the early days of the Solar System.  Why planets spin and tilt as they do remains a topic of research with much insight gained from modern computer modeling and the recent discovery and analysis of hundreds of exoplanets: planets orbiting other stars.
