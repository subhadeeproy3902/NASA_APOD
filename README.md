## Animation: Comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS Tails Prediction

15th October 2024

### Explanation: 

How bright and strange will the tails of Comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS become? The comet has brightened dramatically over the few weeks as it passed its closest to the Sun and, just three days ago, passed its closest to the Earth. C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshanâ€“ATLAS) became of the brightest comets of the past century over the past few days, but was unfortunately hard to see because it was so nearly superposed on the Sun.  As the comet appears to move away from the Sun, it is becoming a remarkable sight -- but may soon begin to fade.  The featured animated video shows how the comet's tails have developed, as viewed from Earth, and gives one prediction about how they might further develop. As shown in the video, heavier parts of the  dust tail that trails the comet have begun to appear to point in nearly the opposite direction from lighter parts of the dust tail as well as the comet's  ion tail, the blue tail that is pushed directly out from the Sun by the solar wind.
