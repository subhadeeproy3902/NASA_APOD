## M16: Pillars of Star Creation

22nd October 2024

### Explanation: 

These dark pillars may look destructive, but they are creating stars.  This pillar-capturing picture of the Eagle Nebula combines visible light exposures taken with the Hubble Space Telescope with infrared images taken with the James Webb Space Telescope to highlight evaporating gaseous globules (EGGs) emerging from pillars of molecular hydrogen gas and dust.  The giant pillars are light years in length and are so dense that interior gas contracts gravitationally to form stars.  At each pillar's end, the intense radiation of bright young stars causes low density material to boil away, leaving stellar nurseries of dense EGGs exposed.  The Eagle Nebula, associated with the open star cluster M16, lies about 7000 light years away.   Jigsaw Challenge: Astronomy Puzzle of the Day
