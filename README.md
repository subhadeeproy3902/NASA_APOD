## Leopard Spots on Martian Rocks

28th September 2025

### Explanation: 

What is creating these unusual spots? Light-colored spots on Martian rocks, each surrounded by a dark border, were discovered last year by NASA's Perseverance Rover currently exploring Mars.  Dubbed leopard spots because of their seemingly similarity to markings on famous Earth-bound predators, these curious patterns are being studied with the possibility they were created by ancient Martian life.  The pictured spots measure only millimeters across and were discovered on a larger rock named Cheyava Falls.  The exciting but unproven speculation is that long ago, microbes generated energy with chemical reactions that turned rock from red to white while leaving a dark biosignature ring, like some similarly appearing spots on Earth rocks. Although other non-biological explanations have not been ruled out,  speculation focusing on this potential biological origin is causing much intrigue.
