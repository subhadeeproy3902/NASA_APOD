## Comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS Over the Lincoln Memorial

14th October 2024

### Explanation: 

Go outside at sunset tonight and see a comet!  C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshanâ€“ATLAS) has become visible in the early evening sky in northern locations to the unaided eye. To see the comet, look west through a sky with a low horizon. If the sky is clear and dark enough, you will not even need binoculars -- the faint tail of the comet should be visible just above the horizon for about an hour.  Pictured, Comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS was captured two nights ago over the Lincoln Memorial monument in Washington, DC, USA.  With each passing day at sunset, the comet and its changing tail should be higher and higher in the sky, although exactly how bright and how long its tails will be can only be guessed.
